# CSE475-Lab1
## Assignment Instructions

1. Name your file `dataframes.py`.
2. The data folder is already located in the `./realestate.csv` of GradeScope, but you can also download it from the link if you want to test it on your local machine. Further information about the dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/477/real+estate+valuation+data+set).
3. You can follow the templates in the starter code but are not required to, so if you feel more comfortable coding in your own fashion, feel free to do that as long as you meet the grading criteria in the next bullet point.
4. The major chunk of your grade will come from sections in the starter code which mention you to report certain values. The graded values are:
   - `shape_data` → equals to (414, 8)
   - `X2_max` → equals to 43.80
   - `X4_max` → equals to 10.0
   - `X3_null` → equals to 14
   - `X4_null` → equals to 13
   - `Y_null` → equals to 9
   - `mean_X3_drop` → greater than 1118.0
   - `mean_X3_fill` → greater than 1069.0
   - `mean_norm_Y` → greater than 0.26
   - `New_count` → equals to 108
   - `Middle_count` → equals to 176
   - `Old_count` → equals to 89
   - `max_id` → equals to 221
   - `txn_dt` → greater than 2013.00
   - `house_age` → greater than 37.0
   - `conv_st` → greater than or equal to 9.0
   - `mean_val_conv_7` (use this weird variable name) → greater than 4630.0
5. Remember not to cheat by just assigning values to these variables; otherwise, you will get 0 immediately.
6. Please see more details in the templates.
